 * of vertices. For example, if there are 5 vertices, then the IDs
 * are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

     * Each of the three constructors throws an exception if any of the
     * following occur:
     * 1\. Use of nonexistent vertices, e.g. use of a vertex with an ID of 5
     *     when there are only 3 vertices.
     * 2\. Encountered a self loop, i.e. an edge from a vertex to itself.
     * 3\. Encountered a multi-edge. Note that in a directed graph, an edge
     *     from A to B and an edge from B to A would not together constitute
     *     a multi-edge, but two edges each from A to B would.
     * 4\. Encountered an edge with weight 0 in a weighted graph. (This only
     *     applies to the last two of the three constructors.)
